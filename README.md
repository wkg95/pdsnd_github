Udacity Programming for Data Science Degree Project 2

### Description
I explored data provided for this project from Motivate, a bikeshare provider.
Data was provided for the first six months of 2017 for the cities of Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I wrote code using Python to answer questions about the provided data.
I also wrote an interactive script to be used in a terminal to filter data and provide output.

### Files used
